Senior Project Stuff (Prework)
I.B Prework (Introduction Application)
Overview:
A simple application template that I made that showcases a welcome message, an image, as well as a button that logs a message when clicked. This gave me the basics of Kotlin programming.
Features:
Display a welcome message with a personalized greeting
Displays an image
Add a button that shows a log message on tap
Implement edge-to-edge layout support for modern Android devices
Proper resource management with layouts and drawable assets
GIF Demonstration:
The GIF will be added later due to a lack of RAM
Future Addons:
Add on the GIF (NOTE: Need a new computer and will be updating this once recieved by instructor)
Make the application a bit more “interactive” in a way
Play around with the UI to add little details such as animations and whatnot.
